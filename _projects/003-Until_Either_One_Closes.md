This is an ongoing relationship between two neighbours: Jin Jin Dumpling House, a Chinese restaurant in Treaty Six land (Saskatoon), Canada, and aka artist-run centre, the gallery next door. All events at aka artist-run will be catered by Jin Jin, until either business closes first. The two neighbours are located in a gentrifying Chinatown, and aka artist-run itself is located within a building that used to house a Chinese restaurant.

A Life of a Craphead project, part of the exhibition *Entertaining Every Second* at aka artist-run centre, initiated in January 2019.
