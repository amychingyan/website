When stuck at work, the bathroom can be an ideal place to hide or recover. I was asked to make an exhibition during the pandemic fall of 2020 for a university gallery, [SFU Gallery](https://www.sfu.ca/galleries/sfu-gallery/past/AmyLamMakeBelieveBathroom.html); as a result, the *Make-Believe Bathroom* is an online bathroom modelled after the actual, physical bathroom closest to the gallery on campus. Users of *Make-Believe Bathroom* can talk to people in stalls next to them, check a phone, view graffiti, leave a message for others, and flush the toilet.
