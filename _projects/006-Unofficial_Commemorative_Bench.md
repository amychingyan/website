The *Unofficial Commemorative Bench* is located in the Glasgow St. Parkette, in Toronto's Chinatown. The bench marks a relationship between the parkette and the development down the street, “CampusOne,” a privately owned residence aimed towards students where a one-bedroom apartment without a kitchen costs $2,000/mo. Residents of the area opposed this development over several years but ultimately lost. As part of the building going forward, a “community benefits” agreement was made between the developer and the city, which led to the renovation of this parkette. I installed plaques, unofficially, that commemorate the residents' opposition. You can see the tower from the bench.
