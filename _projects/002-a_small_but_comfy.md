[a small but comfy house and maybe a dog](https://www.richmondartgallery.org/smallcomfyhouse) at Richmond Art Gallery, BC, with HaeAhn Woo Kwon. From April 22 to June 11, 2023.

The title of this exhibition comes from a text, “Me in the Future,” that I wrote at age eleven and put in a time capsule, speculating by the age of twenty-five I'd be married, have a career, and “a small but comfy house and maybe a dog.” Starting from these childhood fantasies of domestic love and financial stability, this exhibition explores how these dreams function within the wider contexts of colonial history, property, theft, and institutional collections. With sculptures and fountains made in collaboration with [HaeAhn Woo Kwon](https://www.haeahnkwon.com/), a new lending program between the Richmond Art Gallery's collection and the Richmond Public Library next door, Looty, and Feng shui consultation.

This exhibition will be accompanied by an artist book, co-published by Book Works in 2024.

Curated by Su-Ying Lee.
