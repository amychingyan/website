[*Looty Goes to Heaven*](https://eastsideprojects.org/projects/looty-goes-to-heaven/) re-imagines the life of a Pekingese dog that was looted from China during the second Opium War, brought to England, gifted to Queen Victoria and renamed “Looty.” The project takes the form of an animation, a speculative fiction, and a poppy meadow in Birmingham, UK, which is the current site of Crufts, the largest dog show in the world, as well as the home of Ty-phoo tea, a brand named after the Chinese word for doctor. *Looty Goes to Heaven* pulls at the threads of fantasy, death, and sleep within the trades of tea, opium, and dogs.

Presented by Eastside Projects and Birmingham 2022 Festival, summer 2022.

The book is available for purchase at [Art Metropole](https://artmetropole.com/shop/15147) or at Burley Fisher Books in London.
