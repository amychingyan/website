Life of a Craphead was the art collective of myself and Jon McCurley in performance, film, and conceptual art (2016-2020). Our last exhibition, *Entertaining Every Second* (2018-2019), was a project researching the figure of the East/Southeast Asian woman in war. We also organized and hosted the performance art show/livestream Doored, in Toronto and other cities, from 2012-2017. All of our work is archived at [lifeofacraphead.com](https://www.lifeofacraphead.com).
