[*Looty Goes to Heaven 洛蒂上天堂*](https://eastsideprojects.org/projects/looty-goes-to-heaven/) re-imagines the life of a Pekingese dog that was \*looted\* from China during the second Opium War, brought to England, gifted to Queen Victoria and renamed “Looty.” The project takes the form of an animation, a speculative fiction, and a poppy meadow in Birmingham, UK, which is the current site of Crufts, the largest dog show in the world, as well as the home of Ty-phoo tea, a brand named after the Chinese word for doctor. *Looty Goes to Heaven* combines the trades of tea, opium, and dogs with fantasy, death, and sleep.

Presented by Eastside Projects and Birmingham 2022 Festival, summer 2022.
