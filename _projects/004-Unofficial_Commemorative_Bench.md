The Unofficial Commemorative Bench marks a relationship between the parkette and the development down the street, “CampusOne,” a privately owned residence aimed towards students where a one-bdrm *without a kitchen* costs $2,000/mo (u also don’t actually have to be a student to live there?!). Residents of the area opposed this development over several years but ultimately lost. As part of the building going fwd, a “community benefits” agreement was made between the developer and the city, which led to the renovation of this parkette, and these fancy benches, etc. I installed these plaques “unofficially” and u can see the tower from the bench.
