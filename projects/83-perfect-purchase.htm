							Every baby is born with only one nightmare.
						</p>

						<p>
							83% Perfect is a fable about OhNo, a baby burdened with a
							nightmare, who makes friends with OhYes and OhMaybe, both of whom
							bear their own nightmares. The story is based on my earliest
							memories of education and competition, transposed onto the past
							couple years of institutional complicity and hypocrisy. Basically
							it’s a children’s book about the appeal of compliance and the
							necessity of solidarity. —Amy Ching-Yan Lam
						</p>
						<p>
							Designed by Rosen Eveleigh. Published by The Joan and Martin
							Goldfarb Gallery of York University as part of Amy Ching-Yan Lam’s
							solo exhibition 83% Perfect, curated by Jenifer Papararo. The
							exhibition will run from Sept 25, 2025 to January 31, 2026.
							Produced with the support of the Canada Council for the Arts and
							Partners in Art’s Artist-Direct program.
